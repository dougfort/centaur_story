**Project Module:** Simulated Ecosystem Management Game

**Objective:** Using your centaur partnership, manage a virtual biome by allocating resources, introducing species, and mitigating stressors to maximize sustainability and biodiversity.

**Teams & Roles:**
- Each team consists of a child–AI pair (centaur).
- Child leads strategy decisions; AI provides predictive models, risk assessments, and resource forecasts.

**Core Metrics:**
1. **Biodiversity Index (BI):** Aim to keep BI ≥ 70% by maintaining multiple species populations.
2. **Sustainability Score (SS):** Composite metric (water + nutrients + diversity) that must exceed 75% for 10 minutes.

**Resources & Actions (Macros):**
- **Rainfall (💧):** Add 10 mm of water; Cooldown 15 s
- **Fertilize (🪨):** Distribute 5 units of nutrients; Cooldown 20 s
- **Reintroduce (🐾):** Add 3 individuals of a chosen species; Cooldown 30 s
- **Clean-Up (☣️):** Deploy micro-bots to reduce pollution by 10%; Cooldown 25 s
- **HabitatEdit (🏞️):** Alter terrain to create new habitat zones; Cooldown 45 s

**Environmental Stressors (Escalation Ladder):**
1. Drought Event (water −15%)
2. Pest Outbreak (plant health −20%)
3. Pollution Spike (pollution +20%)
4. Wildfire Simulation (vegetation −30%)
5. Invasive Species (imbalance predator/prey)

Stressors activate based on BI and SS thresholds. Expect one stressor every 60 s initially, increasing frequency if BI > 80% or SS > 85% for 2 minutes.

**Procedure:**
1. **Preparation (10 min):** Review current biome state and plan sequence of actions.
2. **Live Session (15 min):** Execute macros via voice commands; AI logs all actions and suggests corrective steps when requested.
3. **Debrief (5 min):** Review logged metrics, discuss decisions, and identify areas for improvement.

**Deliverables:**
- At the end of the session, submit your team’s **Resource Log** and **Stress Response Chart**.
- Each centaur pair must propose **one new macro combo** for potential future use.

**Timeline:**
- **Day 8 Morning:** Introduction & first live simulation session.
- **Day 8 Afternoon:** Practice sandbox for new macro combos.
- **Day 9 Morning:** Final graded run under continuous stressors.

**Assessment:**
- Success if BI ≥ 75% and SS ≥ 80% for at least 10 minutes under medium stressor frequency.
- Bonus for innovative macro combos with documented risk assessments.
