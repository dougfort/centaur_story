ERROR: "resource advisor offline" blared in my head when blackout hit. Jack looked at me, orb was silent.

Plan B: child rule â€” always start with **Fertilize** in drought. I whispered "Fertilize" and AI finally did it on revival.

Leaf was inching down to 45 % so I ran **Clean-Up** next, all manual combos from memory.

Jack noddedâ€”no panic. We realized we need code book in pocket > reliance on AI.

Next: draft offline macro list for emergency runs.

Mood: ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¤ğŸ™‚ (shock â†’ frustration â†’ calm)
