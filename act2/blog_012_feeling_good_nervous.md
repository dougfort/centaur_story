**Title:** 📝 *Day 7 PM Blip* — “Feeling Good and Nervous”

Hey, it’s me—Jack again. Today I’m not talking about codes or macros. I’m thinking about how it felt when Ada and I demo’d in front of everyone. I felt like my heart was popping popcorn, but also… proud? Like when you fall off the bike and then pedal really fast to show you can.

Things I’m proud of:
1) I spoke in a clear voice (no stammers!).  
2) Ada’s rainbow sun was epic—I saw everyone smile.  
3) I learned that mistakes (like forgetting a click) aren’t the end.

But also:
* My stomach felt like a rumbly cave.  
* I kept thinking, “What if someone laughs?”  

Ryden joked I’d do well on a spaceship crew (weird thing to say, Dad), but I know he’s proud.

Tomorrow we start a *real* garden patch. I’m equal parts **excited** and **scared**.

**Mood Meter:** 😊😬💭  (happy → nervous → thoughtful)
