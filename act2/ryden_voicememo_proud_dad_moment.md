*Bedroom hallway, soft hum of nightlight.*

"Jack’s asleep now—finally stopped talking about seesaws and slides at 9:30. He’s got that quiet look of someone who’s done something big. I watched the tutorial feed from my lab; his voice was steady, his face bright. He paused for a second, maybe to breathe, but then kept going—that’s my kid.

I’m jotting this so I remember: four months ago he buried himself in video games, didn’t trust new things. Tonight he trusted the orb and himself in front of a room full of peers. Adoption in two weeks. This feels like the start of the rest of his life.

End memo."
