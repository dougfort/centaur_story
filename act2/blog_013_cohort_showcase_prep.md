**Title:** 🎨🌱 *Day 9 Blip* — “Getting Ready to Shine”

Hey there! It’s Jack again. Tomorrow is the big **Cohort Showcase**, where we finally share our centaur projects—virtual gardens, community plans, all of it. I’m feeling a mix of 🤔 (thinking through my presentation), 💪 (ready to show what I learned), and 🙌 (can’t wait to see everyone else’s work).

Here’s my plan for today:
1. **Review Virtual Garden Playbook** – Make sure the flow is clear:  
   - Start with an overview of water and nutrient balance.  
   - Show charts of BI and SS from our test runs.  
   - Explain how we handled stressors (drought, pests).  

2. **Polish Presentation Slides** – Ada and I are adding:  
   - A short animation of how Shade‑Swap cooled the leaves during wildfire stress.  
   - A snapshot of our real community garden planting from last weekend.  
   - A “Then vs. Now” slide showing my Bee‑Beat macro improvements.  

3. **Practice Speaking** – Ryden is timing me:  
   - Keep it under 60 seconds.  
   - Add one joke (“Why did the bee enroll in coding class? To debug the hive!” 🐝💻).  
   - End with a thank-you slide: “Thanks to Athena and Prof. M for being the best co-pilots.”

I’m also checking my notes on risk vs. reward—making sure I emphasize how Shade‑Swap+Bee‑Beat combo showed teamwork and strategy. I hope Mira’s Soft-Breeze slides look as cool as her sandbox graphics. Everyone’s been practicing hard.

Tomorrow’s showcase starts at 09:30 in the Centaur Studio. Wish me luck—and if you’re reading this, give a virtual high-five! 🖐️
