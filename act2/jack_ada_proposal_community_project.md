**Project Title:** *Centaur Community Garden Initiative*

**Overview:**  
We propose a two-phase community service project: first, create a virtual simulation of a local neighborhood garden using the Simulated Ecosystem Management Game. Then, partner with the local community center to plant pollinator-friendly flowers and monitor growth. Our goal is to apply centaur collaboration skills to benefit both a virtual and real environment.

### Phase 1: Virtual Simulation  

1. **Site Modeling:**  
   - Use satellite imagery of Riverside Park’s east corner.  
   - Define virtual grid zones for flower beds, trees, and water sources.  

2. **Resource Planning:**  
   - Allocate virtual water and nutrients to support flower growth.  
   - Introduce native species (e.g., lavender, coneflower, milkweed) to boost biodiversity.  

3. **Stress Testing:**  
   - Simulate stressors (drought, pests, pollution) to refine resource macros.  
   - Record optimal macro sequences to maintain Water ≥50%, Biodiversity ≥60%.  

4. **Documentation:**  
   - Generate a “Virtual Garden Playbook” with step-by-step macro combos and risk assessments.

### Phase 2: Real-World Implementation  

1. **Partnership & Logistics:**  
   - Collaborate with Riverside Community Center for land access.  
   - Gather soil samples and test nutrient levels with Athena’s rapid analysis protocols.  

2. **Planting & Maintenance:**  
   - Use virtual playbook to guide real planting: spacing, watering schedules, and pest control.  
   - Jack and Ada will lead weekend planting sessions with local volunteers.  

3. **Monitoring & Reporting:**  
   - Deploy affordable moisture sensors; Athena logs data and advises on watering.  
   - Weekly check-ins: record plant health and pollinator visits, adjusting care based on centaur guidance.  

4. **Community Engagement:**  
   - Host “Centaur Garden Days” where kids teach neighbors how to use virtual tools for gardening.  
   - Share success stories on lab-school blog to inspire other centaur teams.

**Expected Outcomes:**  

- **Virtual Success:** Demonstrate BI ≥70% and SS ≥75% in simulation for 15 minutes under stress.  
- **Real-World Impact:** Establish a thriving pollinator-friendly garden in Riverside Park, measured by plant survival rates and pollinator counts.  
- **Skill Development:** Enhance centaur teamwork, real-world problem-solving, and community leadership.
