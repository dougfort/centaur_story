title: "Lab Note \u2013 Cohort Showcase Prep"
---

**Objective:** Summarize cohort readiness and coordinate final feedback before tomorrow’s showcase.

**Participants:** Jack & Ada, Mira & Ben, Jack & Ben, Ada & Mira (four teams total).

**Key Observations:**
1. **Technical Completeness:**  
   - All teams have stable virtual simulations with at least two stressor-response macros functioning.  
   - Jack & Ada’s virtual garden animation is seamless; community planting integration is promising.

2. **Presentation Skills:**  
   - Jack’s pacing under 60 seconds; Ada’s visual design is engaging (rainbow timers).  
   - Mira’s Soft-Breeze graphics need slight color contrast adjustment for visibility.  
   - Ben’s live demo script requires one more practice to reduce filler words.

3. **Risk-Reward Emphasis:**  
   - Each team effectively demonstrated risk calculations; Jack & Ada’s seesaw visual reinforced concept.  
   - Suggest adding quantitative examples for Soft-Breeze (e.g., pollen delta percentages).

4. **Equipment & Logistics:**  
   - Projector has been tested; audio checks complete.  
   - Printed handouts of Virtual Garden Playbook and Community Garden plans ready for distribution.

**Action Items Before 08:00 Tomorrow:**
* Send reminder to parents: Showcase at 09:30 in Centaur Studio (Room 212).  
* Finalize slide export in PDF and PNG formats for backup.  
* Provide one-on-one coaching with Ben to refine his speaking cues at 16:00.  
* Adjust Soft-Breeze slide contrast by 20% for clarity in shared screens.

**Expectation:**  
Teams should be ready to answer audience questions on both technical (macro algorithms, metrics) and practical (real-world garden impact) aspects.
