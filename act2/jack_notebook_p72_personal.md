Tomorrow is the school play. My role is the village messenger. Lines: “News from the king!” I keep mixing up “king” and “queen” when I practice.

Ryden says it’s okay to take a pause. I hope I don’t freeze in front of everyone. The class is watching. 

And beyond that, the adoption decision is next Tuesday. Sometimes I can’t stop thinking they might say no. But Ryden says we’re a family no matter what. It feels weird to plan for adoption when I still don’t feel sure.

Doodle: me wearing a crown sending a letter to a judge with Ryden cheering behind me.

Mood Meter: 😬😟🙂 (nervous → scared → slightly hopeful)

Next:
1) Practice lines with music in background.
2) Sleep early, no screen time.
3) List five things I’m good at. (Helps with confidence.)
