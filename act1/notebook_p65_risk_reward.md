Seesaw doodle: Leaf ⚖️ Pollen  (bottom label: “RISK ROCKS”)

New macro idea: **Shade-Swap** (hide sun 3 sec → cool leaves → spike Bee-Beat!)  Risk guess = 2?  Reward = mega??

Prof M said: “Big rewards rare; safe first, then flair.”  Sounds like popcorn seasoning: butter first, chili next.

Action list:
1) Sandbox Shade-Swap today.
2) Tune BPM if leaf cools.
3) Ask Ryden if seesaw eq works for life stuff (chores vs video games?).

Mood: 🙂🤔  (happy but thinking)
