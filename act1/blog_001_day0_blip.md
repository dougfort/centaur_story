**Title:** 🚀 *Day 0 Blip* — “Hi Internet? Maybe Just Parents.”

Hey! I’m **Jack** (age 9, pro popcorn scientist 🍿). Starting Monday I get a *talking glow-orb buddy* at Lab School! They call it a **Cognitive Assistant** but that’s long, so I’m voting for **Orbie** until it picks its own name. I’m gonna share tiny updates here—no spoilers, just FUN FACTS. Stay tuned for: 🐞 ladybug adventures, possible popcorn volcano math, and why server racks hum like spaceships. —J

**Mood:** 🙂🙂😐  (2 happy, 1 curious)
