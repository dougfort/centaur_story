**Slide 1** Title: *Garden Guardian = Balancing Act*  (graphic: seesaw with Leaf bar ↔ Pollen bar)
**Slide 2** Equation: *Outcome Score* = Leaf × Pollen ÷ Risk
**Slide 3** Examples:
  • *Quiet-Water*  → low risk, small reward
  • *Bee-Beat*  → medium risk, high reward (if BPM tuned)
  • *Style-Flip* rainbow  → high risk, low reward (aesthetics only)
**Slide 4** Interactive: kids place macro cards on risk-reward grid
**Slide 5** Rule of 3: “Test → Sandbox → Go Live” (color-coded flow)
**Slide 6** Exit ticket: each team lists one new macro + predicted risk score (1-5)
