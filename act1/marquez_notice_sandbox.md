**Dear Parents/Caregivers,**

Tomorrow we will activate a *Practice Sandbox* mode in Garden Guardian. In this environment, children may test new macros and visual styles **without risk** to the core health metrics. Assistant prompts remain off, but resets occur every 90 seconds.

Goals:
1. Encourage creative experimentation (color effects, style flips).
2. Teach risk‑reward reasoning before applying macros in official rounds.

Dashboard summaries will differentiate Sandbox sessions (grey header) from standard sessions (blue header). No additional consent required; protocol unchanged.

Best,  
—Prof. Elena Marquez
