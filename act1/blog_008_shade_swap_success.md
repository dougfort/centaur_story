**Title:** ⛅🐝 *Day 5 Blip* — “Cooling Leaves, Boosting Bees!”

Sandbox trial: **Shade‑Swap** = turn sun *off* 3 sec → leaves chill → crank Bee‑Beat 130 BPM right after.

Result: Leaf 85 % (no scorch), Pollen 83 % (new record!). Ada yelled “Science!” so loud the Grump froze for a tick 😂.

Need real‑round proof tomorrow, but Prof M nodded *approvingly* (that’s HUGE).

**Mood Meter:** 🧐😅🤩 (focused → phew → starry‑eyed)
