Subject: Jack’s first handshake with the orb  

Hui-Ling,

Quick field note before I crash: Jack’s pilot group met their cognitive assistants today. I sat in the observation booth—purely “parent hat,” no white-lab-coat. When the orb pulsed his color he *whispered* hello (progress; last year he would have bolted). The assistant answered, “Hello, Operator Jack,” and he laughed—full teeth, no guarded half-smile.

My scientist brain kept rating latency (≈400 ms) and speech prosody, but the dad part just watched his shoulders drop from fight-ready to curious.

Marquez’s protocol seems solid: no GUI, conversational control only. Jack immediately tried a nickname—“Orbie.” The assistant acknowledged without reprimand. Good sign for trust.

Tomorrow they run a simulated garden loop. Jack predicts he’ll “say something silly.” I predict he’ll invent at least three new commands by Friday.

Adoption hearing in 20 days. Moments like this make the waiting tolerable.

—John
