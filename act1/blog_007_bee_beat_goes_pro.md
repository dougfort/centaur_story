**Title:** 🐝🥁 *Day 4 PM Blip* — “We Hit the 80/80!”

LIVE round, scoreboards ON. I waited for Grump’s heat wave, then dropped **Quiet‑Water** 👉 **Bee‑Beat 135 BPM**. Leaf stayed **83 %**, Pollen shot to **82 %**. Crowd (okay, four kids + teachers) cheered like finals day.

Ada slammed rainbow Style‑Flip as *victory confetti* with 5 sec left—didn’t dent Leaf bar. High‑five chain commenced.

Prof M called our macro “publish‑worthy.” Next goal = teach Ben’s orb to spell rhododendron *and* garden at same time. 😜

**Mood Meter:** 😤😲🏅 (determined → wow → badge earned!)
