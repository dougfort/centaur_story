**Title:** 🐝🎶 *Day 4 Blip* — “Sandbox = Science Playground”

Morning sandbox sesh = PURE CHAOS (the fun kind). I mashed **Quiet‑Water** + **Bee‑Beat** at 120 BPM. The pollen bar bounced up‑and‑down like a dance floor ⬆️⬇️⬆️⬇️ but average climbed to **78 %**—best yet! 🌟

Then tried Ada’s **Style‑Flip** rainbow sun—leaf bar dipped :( so we saved that for “victory lap” only.

Prof M says our macros don’t count against health until we move them to live mode. Challenge accepted: tune Bee‑Beat so pollen ≥80 % without leaf crash. Stay tuned.

**Mood Meter:** 😎🤓🎉  (cool → geeky → celebrate)
