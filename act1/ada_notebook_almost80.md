78 % 😭  so close!

I tried **STYLE_FLIP** (spin the sun lamp to rainbow) because pretty > plain BUT that stole 4 s and Grump heat-spiked. Note to self: cool tricks AFTER safe zone.

Jack high-fived me anyway. Said my garden “looked like a disco” 🤣.

Tomorrow = redemption round. New plan:  
1) Quick-Sip right away (quiet).  
2) Warm-Sun β only if leaf <81.  
3) SAVE style flip for last 10-sec victory lap.
