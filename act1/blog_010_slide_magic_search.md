**Title:** 📽️🐝 *Day 6.5 Blip* — “Tutorial Time, Help!”

Prof M wants a 60‑sec demo of Shade‑Swap + Bee‑Beat. I’m teaming with Ada (rainbow queen 🌈). Need:
1. Leaf‑cool timer doodle.
2. BPM counter graphic (drums?)
3. Risk‑Reward seesaw in corner.

If you have slide tricks, drop them in comments! Ada already sketching rainbow timer.

**Mood Meter:** 🤯🎨 (brainstorm swirl)
