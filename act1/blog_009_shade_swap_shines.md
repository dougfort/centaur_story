**Title:** ⭐🌿 *Day 6 Blip* — “Sun-Off, Bees-On, We WIN!”

LIVE round again. Started with Grump heat + weeds. Dropped **Shade-Swap 3 sec**, counted “one-banana-two,” then Bee-Beat 130 BPM. Leaf at **86 %**, Pollen **85 %**!! New studio record 🎉.

Ada’s rainbow sun looked epic *after* timer—risk lesson learned. Mira wants to add soft-breeze macro next.

Prof M called it “case study material.” I just call it COOL.

**Mood Meter:** 😬😎🏆 (nervous → smooth → champion)
