BEE‑BEAT = **LEGIT!** Pollen 82 % 😮  Leaf still green.

Sketch: little bees wearing tiny headphones 🎧→🎶→🌸 (caption: “DJ Bees”)

Idea Zap ⚡: what if real backyard bees like Ryden’s basil could hear bass thru soil? Need mini speaker + permission.

Outside the lab: Ryden promised pizza night if I sleep before 10. Might ask him to order the spicy honey one 🍕🐝 (theme!).

Feeling meter: 🙂🙂🙂🙂|😐|☹️  (4 happy!)

Reminder → self: pack old earbuds, ask Ryden for solder kit, TEST soil‑sound tomorrow after homework.
