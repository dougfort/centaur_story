**Title:** 🌟 *Day 1 Blip* — “It Blinked at Me!”

Hoo‑BOY today was *launch sequence*. We filed into Centaur Studio (smells like new sneakers + marker ink). Prof Marquez said, "When the orb lights YOUR color, say hello." Mine flashed **deep sea‑blue** 💙—looked kinda shy.

I whispered, "Hi, Orbie," but it answered *out loud*—"Hello, Operator Jack." 😱 Everyone giggled, including me. Cool bits:
* Orb shape stayed circle *but* rim rippled like water.
* It asked my favorite **creature** (I said pine marten) then said "Noted." 😏
* No one touched screens; we just TALKED.

Mission log: Garden test tomorrow.  Prediction: I’ll forget code words and say something silly. Wish me luck!

**Mood Meter:** 🙂🤯🙂  (excited–mind‑blown–still excited)
