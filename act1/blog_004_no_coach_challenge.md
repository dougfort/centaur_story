**Title:** 🌞 *Day 3 Blip* — “80 Percent or Bust!”

RULES today: teachers zip it, orbs zip it. We centaurs fly solo. Goal = keep Leaf Health ≥ **80 %** for 3 minutes.

**START**  
Heat wave AGAIN. I whispered Warm-Sun β *before* the Grump dropped clouds (yay predictive!) Leaf bar hovered 82–83 %. My heart thumped like mad.

Then aphids spawned 🙄. Used Ladybug ×2 *and* invented new code **Quiet-Water** (1 tiny sip) so bees wouldn’t freak. It worked! Leaf stayed **81 %**, pollen ~70 %.

Timer buzzed = VICTORY!! Mira and Ben also cleared 80 but Ada’s garden dipped 78 (she tried “style pts” 😂).

**Takeaways:**  
* Talking soft beats yelling.  
* New codes count if orb understands.  
* My hands shook after but in a good way.

**Mood Meter:** 😰😃🏆
