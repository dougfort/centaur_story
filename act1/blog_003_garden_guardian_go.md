**Title:** 🐞 *Day 2 Blip* — “Ladybugs to the Rescue”

First *real* game today: **Garden Guardian** 🌱. Screen shows a tiny backyard with marigolds + basil + health bars that wiggle like video‑game hearts.

**ROUND 1**
House AI (a.k.a. “The Grump”) blasted heat. Leaf bar ⬇️ to **74 %**. I panicked and said, “Um, Quick‑Sip?” but forgot the amount. *Athena* asked, “Confirm 15 mL?”—I squeaked YES. Bar climbed to 78 %. Phew!

**ROUND 2**
Aphid swarm! 😖 I yelled “Two ladybug scouts!” Athena: “Deployed.” Grump threw clouds ⇒ bees got lazy. We ended at 64 %. Not great.

**LESSONS:**
1. Remember **Warm‑Sun β** code (sun dial +2 clicks, wait 6 s).
2. Do *not* scream commands—Athena hears fine.
3. Ladybugs = cutest tank units ever. 🐞💪

Tomorrow we practice without coach prompts. Goal: keep garden ≥ 80 %. Think we can? Tell me in comments! —J
