*Kitchen, lights off but microwave clock blue.*

“Note to self: Jack’s Garden Guardian debut—high excitement, no meltdown. He forgot the water macro amount; instead of freezing, he asked Athena. That’s new. Orb latency steady under half a second, but more important: *Jack waited* for confirmation. Good self-regulation.

Leaf-health dip didn’t discourage him—he framed it as ‘lesson one.’ I heard him rehearsing Warm-Sun beta code to the cat on the way to bed.

Marquez’s metrics show two guidance prompts—acceptable. I’m cautious: micro-bee avatars could trigger his how-big-is-a-sting fear; must ask Elena to preview assets.

Overall: confidence inching ahead of anxiety. Adoption hearing in 19 days feels… survivable.

End memo.”
