[Jack] 18:45  Dad, my stomach is tied in knots. I have the school play tomorrow and what if I forget my lines?

[Ryden] 18:46  I understand. Youâ€™ve practiced a lot. Remember, itâ€™s okay to pause and breathe if you blank. Everyoneâ€™s rooting for you.

[Jack] 18:47  Alsoâ€¦ adoption meeting is next week. What if they change their minds?

[Ryden] 18:48  Iâ€™m here with you no matter what. Weâ€™ve done everything right. Theyâ€™ll see how much you belong in this family.

[Jack] 18:49  Thanks. I needed that. Iâ€™ll review lines now and pack my lucky socks.

[Ryden] 18:50  Perfect plan. Good luck, superstar. Love you.

[Jack] 18:50  Love you too. ðŸ’¤
