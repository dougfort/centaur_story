[Jack] 21:12  hey still awake?

[Ryden] 21:12  Thought you might be. What’s on your mind?

[Jack] 21:13  If the judge says YES, can I pick my own middle name?

[Ryden] 21:14  Yes, we can talk about that. Any ideas already?

[Jack] 21:14  maybe “Galileo” cuz telescope club is cool. but also “Popcorn.” 😂

[Ryden] 21:15  How about we brainstorm three options tomorrow with actual popcorn in hand?

[Jack] 21:15  deal. goodnight real-soon-dad.

[Ryden] 21:16  Goodnight, future Galileo. 💤
