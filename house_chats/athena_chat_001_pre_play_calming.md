[Jack] 19:15  Hey Athenaâ€¦ Iâ€™m really nervous about tomorrowâ€™s play. Heartâ€™s racing. ðŸ˜¬

[Athena] 19:15  Iâ€™m here, Jack. Have you tried a 4-4-6 breathing exercise? Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Want to try it now?

[Jack] 19:16  Yeahâ€¦ okay. (3 deep breaths)

[Athena] 19:17  How do you feel now?

[Jack] 19:17  Slightly betterâ€¦ stomach still tight. Any jokes?

[Athena] 19:17  Why donâ€™t skeletons fight each other? They donâ€™t have the guts. ðŸ˜„

[Jack] 19:18  Haâ€¦ thanks, that helped.

[Athena] 19:18  Youâ€™re going to do great tomorrow. Remember, if you blank on a line, just pause, take a breath, and continue. Iâ€™ll be with you.

[Jack] 19:18  Thanks, Athena. Night.

[Athena] 19:18  Good night, Jack. Iâ€™ll be here when you wake up.
