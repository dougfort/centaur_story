FRIDAY NIGHT = POPCORN MISSION ✅

Microwave 2:00 (pop freq sweet-spot ≈ 3 Hz!!) 🍿💥

Ryden said "movie later" but he’s starin at email.  Bet it’s boring professor stuff.

Sketch: (little doodle of server rack ↔️ rocket)  caption = "hum = warp drive?"

Feeling meter: 🙂🙂🙂 |😐😐|☹️   (3 happy, 0 sad)  GOOD.

Plan: ask Ryden if we can build popcorn VOLCANO tomorrow.
