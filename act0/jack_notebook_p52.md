MAIL DAY!
Ryden gave me fat envelope 😮  Comic about glow-orb “study buddy.”

[sketch: round orb with ???? tail that curls like question mark]
Caption: "WHAT IF IT GROWS A TAIL WHEN IT LIKES ME?"

Questions 4 Monday:
1) Can I name orb?  (Pan?)
2) Are bugs allowed in pocket during studio block?
3) If orb is OFF at lunch will it get lonely?

Mood check: 🙂🙂|😐|☹️  (2 happy, 1 meh)

Idea zap ⚡: teach orb popcorn VOLCANO math!!
